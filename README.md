# Julia Scientific Programming

This repository contains notes and exercises taken from [Julia Scientific Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming/home/week/1) course offered by University of Cape Town on Coursera. 

This course aims to teach the basic syntax of Julia and its core features. I highly recommend this course for those interested in Scientific Programming and High Performing Computers. 

> This course can be followed for free. You will just lose the opportunity to receive a final certification.
