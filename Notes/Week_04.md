## Week 04

The last section of this course is devoted to the flavours of `descriptive` and `inferential` statistics, with an overview of some useful packages and functions.

I did not report here my notes here, because they would be exactly equal to their notebooks. Therefore, I highly recommend to follow their material to know a bit more on the topic!
